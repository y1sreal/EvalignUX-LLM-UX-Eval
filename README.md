# EvalignUX-LLM-UX-Eval

## Paradigm definitions
-   Dyadic human-AI interaction, where end users interact with AI system, and end users are not AI creators.
    
-   Polyadic human-AI interaction, where AI sits between two or many types of end users, and these end users are not AI creators either.
    
-   Monadic human-AI interaction, where the end users are defining AI functions and constantly revising AI and they are the co-creators of the human-AI symbiosis.
